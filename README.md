An executable for viewing point cloud data from [PCD (Point Cloud
Data)](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php)
files, [PLY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_\(file_format\)) files, or
raw, single precision 3D vertex data.

The executable colorizes points based on distance from the camera, and
can save the current view along with the camera pose (by hitting the
`f` key) so that posed depth maps may be obtained.

The package also installs a library that can be used to load and
render point data in other OpenGL applications.
